The therapeutic armamentarium for moderate-to-severe psoriasis is abundant following the transformative introduction of biologic therapies with twenty available medicines1. Risankizumab (SKYRIZIÂ®), a 12 weekly interleukin(IL)-23 inhibitor, was identified in a Cochrane network meta-analysis as one of the most effective drugs for psoriasis.

Drug safety is a key consideration and differentiator between medicines for clinicians and people with psoriasis. As there are known associations between psoriasis and cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), which share similar aetiologies through atherosclerosis and upregulated immunological pro-inflammatory pathways, pharmacovigilance studies have studied whether treatments for psoriasis may exacerbate or induce the onset of these conditions. This concern was exemplified by the finding of an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) associated with briakinumab, a IL12/23 p40 subunit inhibitor, in the explanatory clinical trials programme for psoriasis leading to its withdrawal from the therapeutic pipeline. As yet, there is no consistent evidence of an elevated risk of MACE for any of the drugs currently licensed and approved for moderate-to-severe psoriasis1, and importantly no significant safety signals emerged from analyses of 17 clinical trials of risankizumab in people with psoriasis.

However, a recent disproportionality analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) in 2022 found that risankizumab was associated with significantly disproportionate cerebrovascular event reporting compared to other psoriasis treatments, including guselkumab, another IL-23 inhibitor, which was previously unreported. This led to a commentary suggesting that dermatologists may now be less likely to prescribe this highly effective treatment, in particular avoiding risankizumab in people with a high cardiovascular risk profile. The same authors called for multi-national observational studies to fully understand this potential safety issue. This safety signal is not expected, as IL-23 is thought to be a driver for ischaemic tissue damage in stroke, and pharmacological blockade of IL-23 in mouse models lead to reduced cerebral infarction.

As a response to this potential safety signal, we willinitiate a multinational network comparative safety cohort study to investigate the risk of CVAs and other MACEs associated with risankizumab among people with psoriasis.
